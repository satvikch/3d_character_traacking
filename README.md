# Interactive 3D Character with Three.js

Developed an Interactive 3D character that interacts with the user's mouse pointer where the head tracks the mouse pointer and on clicking the character the character performs certain actions.

This project was done as a work/semi-project in SER 591 (HCI) course at Arizona State University.

The 3D character blender glb file and the costume values of the project was inspired and articulated from the following article: [Article on Codrops](https://tympanus.net/codrops/?p=43796)
